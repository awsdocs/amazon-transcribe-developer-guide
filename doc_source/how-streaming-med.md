# Using Amazon Transcribe Medical streaming with HTTP/2<a name="how-streaming-med"></a>

Amazon Transcribe Medical uses a format called *event stream encoding* for streaming\-med transcription\. This format encoded binary data with header information that describes the contents of each event\. For more information, see [Event stream encoding](streaming-setting-up.md#streaming-event-stream)\. You can use this information for applications that call the Amazon Transcribe Medical endpoint without using an SDK\. 

When Amazon Transcribe Medical uses the [HTTP/2 protocol](https://http2.github.io/) for streaming medical transcriptions, the key components for a streaming medical request are:
+ A header frame\. This contains the HTTP/2 headers for the request, and a signature in the `authorization` header that Amazon Transcribe Medical uses as a seed signature to sign the following data frames\.
+ One or more message frames in event stream encoding\. The frame contains metadata and the raw audio bytes\.
+ An end frame\. This is a signed message in event stream encoding with an empty body\.

## Streaming request<a name="streaming-med-request"></a>

To make a streaming request, you use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_streaming_StartMedicalStreamTranscription.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_streaming_StartMedicalStreamTranscription.html) API\. 

### Header frame<a name="streaming-med-header"></a>

The header frame is the authorization frame for the streaming transcription\. Amazon Transcribe Medical uses the value of the `authorization` header as the seed for generating a chain of authorization headers for the data frames in the request\. 

#### Required headers<a name="required-headers"></a>

The header frame of a request to Amazon Transcribe Medical requires the following HTTP/2 headers\.

```
POST /medical-stream-transcription HTTP/2
host: transcribestreaming.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
authorization: Generated value
x-amz-target: com.amazonaws.transcribe.Transcribe.StartMedicalStreamTranscription
x-amz-content-sha256: STREAMING-MEDAWS4-HMAC-SHA256-EVENTS
x-amz-date: 20220208T235959Z
x-amzn-transcribe-language-code: en-US
x-amzn-transcribe-media-encoding: flac
x-amzn-transcribe-sample-rate: 16000
Content-type: application/vnd.amazon.eventstream
transfer-encoding: chunked
```

In the request, use the following values for the `host`, `authorization`, and `x-amz-date` headers:
+ **`host`**: Use the AWS Region where you are calling Amazon Transcribe Medical\. For a list of valid AWS Regions, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#transcribe_region) in the *AWS General Reference*\. 
+ **authorization**: This is a generated field\. To learn more about creating a signature, see [Signing AWS requests with Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_signing.html)\.
+ **`x-amz-date`**: The date and time the signature is created\. The format is YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ, where YYYY=year, MM=month, DD=day, HH=hour, MM=minute, SS=seconds, and 'T' and 'Z' are fixed characters\. For more information, refer to [Handling Dates in Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-date-handling.html)\.

For more information about the headers specific to Amazon Transcribe Medical, see the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_streaming_StartMedicalStreamTranscription.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_streaming_StartMedicalStreamTranscription.html) API\.

### Data frames<a name="streaming-med-data"></a>

Each request contains one or more data frames\. The data frames use event stream encoding\. The encoding supports bidirectional data transmission between a client and a server\. 

There are two steps to creating a data frame:

1. Combine the raw audio data with metadata to create the payload of the request\. 

1. Combine the payload with a signature to form the event message that is sent to Amazon Transcribe Medical\.

The following diagram shows how this works\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/images/streaming10.png)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/)

#### Create the audio event<a name="audio-event"></a>

To create the message to send to Amazon Transcribe Medical, create the audio event\. Combine the headers described in the following table with a chunk of audio bytes into an event\-encoded message\.


| Header name byte length | Header name \(string\) | Header value type | Value string byte length | Value string \(UTF\-8\) | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 13 | :content\-type | 7 | 24 | application/octet\-stream | 
| 11 | :event\-type | 7 | 10 | AudioEvent | 
| 13 | :message\-type | 7 | 5 | event | 

To create the payload for the event message, use a buffer in raw\-byte format\.

#### Create the message<a name="dataframe"></a>

Create a data frame using the audio event payload to send to Amazon Transcribe Medical\. The data frame contains event\-encoding headers that include the current date and a signature for the audio chunk and the audio event\. To indicate to Amazon Transcribe Medical that the audio stream is complete, send an empty data frame that contains only the date and signature\.


| Header name byte length | Header name \(string\) | Header value type | Value string byte length | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 16 | :chunk\-signature | 6 | varies | generated signature | 
| 5 | :date | 8 | 8 | timestamp | 

To create the signature for the data frame, first create a string to sign, and then calculate the signature for the event\. Construct the string to sign as follows\.

```
String stringToSign =
    "AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD" +
    "\n" +
    DATE +
    "\n" +
    KEYPATH +
    "\n" +
    Hex(priorSignature) +
    "\n" +
    HexHash(nonSignatureHeaders) +
    "\n" +
    HexHash(payload);
```
+ **`DATE`**: The current date and time in Universal Time Coordinated \(UTC\) and using the [ISO 8601 format](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)\. Don't include milliseconds in the date\. For example, 20220127T223754Z is 22:37:54 on 1/27/2022\.
+ **`KEYPATH`**: The signature scope in the format `date/region/service/aws4_request`\. For example, `20220127/us-west-2/transcribe/aws4_request`\.
+ **`priorSignature`**: The signature for the previous frame\. For the first data frame, use the signature of the header frame\.
+ **`nonSignatureHeaders`**: The `DATE` header encoded as a string\.
+ **`payload`**: The byte buffer containing the audio event data\.
+ **`Hex`**: A function that encodes its input into a hexadecimal representation\.
+ **`HexHash`**: A function that first creates a SHA\-256 hash of its input and then uses the `Hex` function to encode the hash\.

After you have constructed the string to sign, sign it using the key that you derived for Signature Version 4, as follows\. For details, see [Examples of How to Derive a Signing Key for Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

```
String signature = HMACSHA256(derivedSigningKey, stringToSign);
```
+ **`HMACSHA256`**: A function that creates a signature using the SHA\-256 hash function\.
+ **`derivedSigningKey`**: The Signature Version 4 signing key\.
+ **`stringToSign`**: The string that you calculated for the data frame\.

After you have calculated the signature for the data frame, construct a byte buffer containing the date, the signature, and the audio event payload\. Send the byte array to Amazon Transcribe Medical for transcription\.

### End frame<a name="end-frame"></a>

To indicate that the audio stream is complete, send an end frame to Amazon Transcribe Medical\. The *end frame* is a data frame with an empty payload\. You construct the end frame the same way that you construct a data frame\.

## Streaming response<a name="streaming-med-response"></a>

Responses from Amazon Transcribe Medical are also sent using event stream encoding\. Use this information to decode a response from the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_streaming_StartMedicalStreamTranscription.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_streaming_StartMedicalStreamTranscription.html) API\.
