# Transcribing streaming audio<a name="how-streaming-transcription"></a>

Streaming transcription takes a stream of your audio data and transcribes it in real time\. Streaming uses HTTP/2 or WebSocket streams so that the results of the transcription are returned to your application while you send more audio to Amazon Transcribe\. Use streaming transcription when you want to make the results of live audio transcription available immediately or when you have an audio file that you want to process as it is transcribed\.

You can use streaming transcription with the following languages:
+ Australian English \(en\-AU\)
+ British English \(en\-GB\)
+ US English \(en\-US\)
+ French \(fr\-FR\)
+ Canadian French \(fr\-CA\)
+ German \(de\-DE\)
+ Italian \(it\-IT\)
+ US Spanish \(es\-US\)
