# Infrastructure security in Amazon Transcribe<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, Amazon Transcribe is protected by the AWS global network security\. For information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/)\. To design your AWS environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see [Infrastructure Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html) in *Security Pillar AWS Well‚ÄêArchitected Framework*\.

You use AWS published API calls to access Amazon Transcribe through the network\. Clients must support the following:
+ Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) 1\.0 or later\. We recommend TLS 1\.2 or later\.
+ Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\) such as DHE \(Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman\) or ECDHE \(Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.
