# Starting a real\-time Call Analytics transcription<a name="tca-start-stream"></a>

Before starting a real\-time Call Analytics transcription, you must create all the [categories](tca-categories-stream.md) you want Amazon Transcribe to match in your call\.

**Note**  
Call Analytics transcripts can't be retroactively matched to new categories\. Only the categories you create *before* starting a Call Analytics transcription can be applied to that transcription output\.

If you've created one or more categories, and your audio matches all the rules within at least one of your categories, Amazon Transcribe flags your output with the matching categories\. If you choose not to use categories, or if your audio doesn't match the rules specified in your categories, your transcript isn't flagged\.

To include post\-call analytics with your real\-time Call Analytics transcription, you must provide an Amazon S3 bucket in your request using the `OutputLocation` parameter\. You must also include a `DataAccessRoleArn` that has write permissions to the specified bucket\. A separate transcript is produced and stored in the specified bucket upon completion of your real\-time Call Analytics streaming session\.

With real\-time Call Analytics, you also have the option to create real\-time category alerts; refer to [Creating real\-time alerts for category matches](#tca-create-alert-stream) for instructions\.

To start a real\-time Call Analytics transcription, you can use the **AWS Management Console**, **HTTP/2**, or **WebSockets**; see the following for examples:

**Important**  
Currently, the AWS Management Console only offers a demo for real\-time Call Analytics with pre\-loaded audio examples\. If you want to use your own audio, you must use the API \(HTTP/2, WebSockets, or an SDK\)\.

## AWS Management Console<a name="analytics-start-console-stream"></a>

Use the following procedure to start a Call Analytics request\. The calls that match all characteristics defined by a category are labeled with that category\.

**Note**  
Only a demo is available in the AWS Management Console\. To start a custom real\-time analytics transcription, you must use the [API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_streaming_StartCallAnalyticsStreamTranscription.html)\.

1. In the navigation pane, under Amazon Transcribe Call Analytics, choose **Analyze a real\-time call**\.  
![\[Amazon Transcribe console screenshot: the 'analyze a streaming call' demo page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/images/analytics-start-stream.png)

1. For **Step 1: Specify input audio**, choose a demo test file from the dropdown menu\.  
![\[Amazon Transcribe console screenshot: a dropdown selection for the demo's input audio.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/images/analytics-start-stream-settings1.png)

1. For **Step 2: Review call categories**, you have the option to review the real\-time Call Analytics categories you previously created\. All real\-time Call Analytics categories are applied to your transcription\.

   Choosing **View categories** opens a new pane that shows your existing real\-time Call Analytics categories and provides a link to create new ones\.  
![\[Amazon Transcribe console screenshot: the 'call analytics categories' page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/images/analytics-start-stream-settings2.png)

1. For **Step 3: Configure input and output**, you have the option to apply additional settings\.

   Choosing **Configure advanced settings** opens a new pane where you can specify content redaction settings\.  
![\[Amazon Transcribe console screenshot: the advanced settings panels, all collapsed.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/images/analytics-start-stream-settings3.png)

   Once you've made all your selections, choose **Save** to return to the main page\.

1. To apply additional analytics, you can toggle on **Post\-call Analytics**\. This provides you with the same analytics as a post\-call analytics transcription, including interruptions, loudness, non\-talk time, talk speed, talk time, issues, action items, and outcomes\. Post\-call analytics output is stored in a separate file from your real\-time Call Analytics transcript\.  
![\[Amazon Transcribe console screenshot: the post-call analytics panel, collapsed.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/images/analytics-start-stream-post-call1.png)

   If you apply post\-call analytics, you must specify an Amazon S3 output file destination and an IAM role\. You can optionally choose to encrypt your output\.  
![\[Amazon Transcribe console screenshot: the post-call analytics panel, expanded.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/images/analytics-start-stream-post-call1a.png)

1. Choose **Start streaming**\.

## HTTP/2 stream<a name="analytics-start-http2"></a>

This example creates an HTTP/2 request with Call Analytics enabled\. For more information on using HTTP/2 streaming with Amazon Transcribe, see [Setting up an HTTP/2 stream](streaming-http2.md)\. For more detail on parameters and headers specific to Amazon Transcribe, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_streaming_StartCallAnalyticsStreamTranscription.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_streaming_StartCallAnalyticsStreamTranscription.html)\.

This example includes [post\-call analytics](tca-post-call.md)\. If you don't want post\-call analytics, remove the `PostCallAnalyticsSettings` section from the request\.

Note that the configuration event shown in the following example needs to be passed as the first event in the stream\.

Parameter definitions can be found in the [API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_Reference.html); parameters common to all AWS API operations are listed in the [Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html) section\.

**Tip**  
The above HTTP/2 and WebSocket examples include post\-call analytics\. If you don't want post\-call analytics, remove the `PostCallAnalyticsSettings` section from the request\.  
If you enable `PostCallAnalyticsSettings`, you must send a configuration event as the first event\. Your configuration event includes settings for `ChannelDenifitions` and `PostStreamAnalyticsSettings`, as shown in the preceding examples\.  
Binary data are passed as a binary message with `content-type application/octet-stream` and the configuration event is passed as a text message with `content-type application/json`\.  
For more information, see [Setting up a streaming transcription](streaming-setting-up.md)\.

## Creating real\-time alerts for category matches<a name="tca-create-alert-stream"></a>

To set up real\-time alerts, you must first create a [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_TranscriptFilter.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_TranscriptFilter.html) category with the `REAL_TIME` flag\. This flag allows your category to be applied to real\-time Call Analytics transcriptions\.

For instructions on creating a new category, see [Creating categories for real\-time transcriptions](tca-categories-stream.md)\.

When you start your real\-time Call Analytics transcription, all categories that have the `REAL_TIME` flag are automatically applied to your transcription output at a segment level\. If a `TranscriptFilterType` match occurs, it appears under the `CategoryEvent` section of your transcript\. You can then use this parameter and its sub\-parameters, `MatchedCategories` and `MatchedDetails`, to set up custom real\-time alerts\.

Here's an example of real\-time Call Analytics transcription output for a `CategoryEvent` match:

```
"CategoryEvent": { 
    "MatchedCategories": [ "shipping-complaint" ],
    "MatchedDetails": { 
        "my package never arrived" : { 
            "TimestampRanges": [    
                { 
                    "BeginOffsetMillis": 19010,
                    "EndOffsetMillis": 22690
                }
            ]
        }
    }
},
```

The previous example represents an exact text match to the speech "*my package never arrived*," which represents a rule within the 'shipping\-complaint' category\.

You can set up your real\-time alert to include any combination of the listed parameters\. For example, you could set your alert to include only the phrase that was matched \(`MatchedDetails`\) or only the category name \(`MatchedCategories`\)\. Or you could set your alert to include all parameters\.

How you set up your real\-time alerts depends on your organization's interfaces and your desired alert type\. For example, you could set a `CategoryEvent` match to send a pop\-up notification, an email, a text, or any other alert your system can accept\.
