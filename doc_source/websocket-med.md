# Establish a bi\-directional connection using the WebSocket protocol<a name="websocket-med"></a>

You can use the [WebSocket protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) to open a bi\-directional connection that is designed to be secure with Amazon Transcribe Medical\. You encode the audio stream with event stream encoding, and Amazon Transcribe Medical returns a stream of text in JSON blobs that are also encoded using event stream encoding\. For more information, see [Event stream encoding](event-stream-med.md)\. You can use the information in this section to create applications using the WebSocket library of your choice\.

## Adding a policy for WebSocket requests to your IAM role<a name="websocket-iam-med"></a>

To use the WebSocket protocol to call Amazon Transcribe Medical, you need to attach the following policy to the IAM role that makes the request\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "transcribemedicalstreaming",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "transcribe:StartMedicalStreamTranscription",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Creating a pre\-signed URI<a name="websocket-url-med"></a>

You need to construct a URI for your WebSocket request that contains the information needed to set up communication between your application and Amazon Transcribe Medical\. To open a bi\-directional connection, you must use port 8443\. WebSocket streaming\-med uses the Amazon Signature Version 4 process for signing requests\. Signing the request helps to verify the identity of the requester and to protect your audio data in transit\. It also protects against potential replay attacks\. For more information about Signature Version 4, see [ Signing AWS API Requests ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

The URI has the following format\. Line breaks have been added for readability\.

```
GET wss://transcribestreaming.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:8443/medical-stream-transcription-websocket
?language-code=languageCode
&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE%2F20220208%2Fus-west-2%2Ftranscribe%2Faws4_request
&X-Amz-Date=20220208T235959Z
&X-Amz-Expires=250
&X-Amz-Security-Token=security-token
&X-Amz-Signature=Signature Version 4 signature 
&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host
&media-encoding=flac
&sample-rate=16000
&session-id=sessionId
&specialty=specialty
&type=type
```

For TYPE, it is best to select CONVERSATION if your use case involves multiple speakers engaged in a discussion\. An example would be a conversation between a clinician and a patient\. Select DICTATION if your use case involves a single speaker where a person is dictating speech\. An example would be if a physician is dictating medical notes for data entry purposes after a patient encounter\. 

Use the following values for the URI parameters:
+ **language\-code** – The language code for the input audio\. The valid value is `en-US`\.
+ **media\-encoding** – The encoding used for the input audio\. The valid value is `pcm`\.
+ **sample\-rate** – The sample rate of the input audio in hertz; sample rates of 16,000 Hz or higher are accepted\. 
+ **sessionId** – Optional\. An identifier for the transcription session\. If you don't provide a session ID, Amazon Transcribe Medical generates one for you and returns it in the response\.
+ **specialty** – The specialty of the medical domain\. Valid values are `PRIMARYCARE`, `CARDIOLOGY`, `NEUROLOGY`, `ONCOLOGY`, `RADIOLOGY`, and `UROLOGY`\.
+ **type** – The type of audio\. Must be `DICTATION` or `CONVERSATION`\.

 The remaining parameters are Signature Version 4 parameters: 
+ **X\-Amz\-Algorithm** – The algorithm you're using in the signing process\. The only valid value is `AWS4-HMAC-SHA256`\.
+ **X\-Amz\-Credential** – A string formed by concatenating your access key ID, the date, your AWS Region, the AWS service you're calling, and a standard termination term\. Each of these components is separated by '`%2F`'\. This is the general form:

  *your\-access\-key\-id*%2F*date*%2F*AWS\-Region*%2F*AWS\-service*%2Faws4\_request

  For more information, refer to [Handling Dates in Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-date-handling.html)\.
+ **X\-Amz\-Date** – The date and time the signature is created\. The format is YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ, where YYYY=year, MM=month, DD=day, HH=hour, MM=minute, SS=seconds, and 'T' and 'Z' are fixed characters\. For more information, refer to [Handling Dates in Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-date-handling.html)\.
+ **X\-Amz\-Expires** – The length of time in seconds until the credentials expire\. The maximum value is 300 seconds \(5 minutes\)\.
+ **X\-Amz\-Security\-Token** – Optional\. A Signature Version 4 token for temporary credentials\. If you specify this parameter, include it in the canonical request\. For more information, see [Requesting Temporary Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html) in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide*\.
+ **X\-Amz\-Signature** – The Signature Version 4 signature that you generated for the request\.
+ **X\-Amz\-SignedHeaders** – The headers that are signed when creating the signature for the request\. The only valid value is `host`\.

To construct the URI for the request and create the Signature Version 4 signature, use the following steps\. The examples are in pseudocode\.

**Task 1: Create a canonical request**

Create a string that includes information from your request in a standardized format\. This ensures that when AWS receives the request, it can calculate the same signature that you calculate in Task 3\. For more information, see [Create a Canonical Request for Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-create-canonical-request.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

1. Define variables for the request in your application\.

   ```
   # HTTP verb
   method = "GET"
   # Service name
   service = "transcribe"
   # Region
   region = "us-west-2"
   # Amazon Transcribe streaming-med endpoint
   endpoint = "https://transcribestreaming.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:8443"
   # Host
   host = "transcribestreaming.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:8443"
   # Date and time of request
   amz-date = YYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z'
   # Date without time for credential scope
   datestamp = YYYYMMDD
   ```

1. Create a canonical URI\. The canonical URI is the part of the URI between the domain and the query string\.

   ```
   canonical_uri = "/medical-stream-transcription-websocket"
   ```

1. Create the canonical headers and signed headers\. Note the trailing `"\n"` in the canonical headers\.
   + Append the lowercase header name followed by a colon\.
   + Append a comma\-separated list of values for that header\. Do not sort the values in headers that have multiple values\.
   + Append a new line \(`\n`\)\.

   ```
   canonical_headers = "host:" + host + "\n"
   signed_headers = "host"
   ```

1. Match the algorithm to the hashing algorithm\. You must use SHA\-256\.

   ```
   algorithm = "AWS4-HMAC-SHA256"
   ```

1. Create the credential scope, which scopes the derived key to the date, AWS Region, and service to which the request is made\.

   ```
   credential_scope = datestamp + "/" + region + "/" + service + "/" + "aws4_request"
   ```

1. Create the canonical query string\. Query string values must be URI\-encoded and sorted by name\.
   + Sort the parameter names by character code point in ascending order\. Parameters with duplicate names should be sorted by value\. For example, a parameter name that begins with the uppercase letter F precedes a parameter name that begins with a lowercase letter b\.
   + Do not URI\-encode any of the unreserved characters that [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) defines: A\-Z, a\-z, 0\-9, hyphen \( \- \), underscore \( \_ \), period \( \. \), and tilde \( \~ \)\.
   + Percent\-encode all other characters with %XY, where X and Y are hexadecimal characters \(0\-9 and uppercase A\-F\)\. For example, the space character must be encoded as %20 \(not using '\+', as some encoding schemes do\) and extended UTF\-8 characters must be in the form %XY%ZA%BC\.
   + Double\-encode any equals \( = \) characters in parameter values\.

   ```
   canonical_querystring  = "X-Amz-Algorithm=" + algorithm
   canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-Credential="+ URI-encode(access key + "/" + credential_scope)
   canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-Date=" + amz_date 
   canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-Expires=250"
   canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-Security-Token=" + token
   canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=" + signed_headers
   canonical_querystring += "&language-code=en-US&media-encoding=flac&sample-rate=16000"
   canonical_querystring += "&specialty=PRIMARYCARE"
   canonical_querystring += "&type=DICTATION"
   ```

1. Create a hash of the payload\. For a GET request, the payload is an empty string\.

   ```
   payload_hash = HashSHA256(("").Encode("utf-8")).HexDigest()
   ```

1. Combine all of the elements to create the canonical request\.

   ```
   canonical_request = method + '\n' 
      + canonical_uri + '\n' 
      + canonical_querystring + '\n' 
      + canonical_headers + '\n' 
      + signed_headers + '\n' 
      + payload_hash
   ```

**Task 2: Create the string to sign**

The string to sign contains meta information about your request\. You use the string to sign in the next step when you calculate the request signature\. For more information, see [Create a String to Sign for Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-create-string-to-sign.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.
+ Create the string\.

  ```
  string_to_sign=algorithm + "\n"
     + amz_date + "\n"
     + credential_scope + "\n"
     + HashSHA256(canonical_request.Encode("utf-8").HexDigest()
  ```

**Task 3: Calculate the signature**

You derive a signing key from your AWS secret access key\. For a greater degree of protection, the derived key is specific to the date, service, and AWS Region\. You use the derived key to sign the request\. For more information, see [ Calculate the Signature for AWS Signature Version 4 ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-calculate-signature.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

The code assumes that you have implemented the `GetSignatureKey` function to derive a signing key\. For more information and example functions, see [Examples of How to Derive a Signing Key for Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

The function `HMAC(key, data)` represents an HMAC\-SHA256 function that returns the results in binary format\.
+ Create the signing key and sign the string to sign\.

  ```
  #Create the signing key
  signing_key = GetSignatureKey(secret_key, datestamp, region, service)
                  
  # Sign the string_to_sign using the signing key
  signature = HMAC.new(signing_key, (string_to_sign).Encode("utf-8"), Sha256()).HexDigest
  ```

**Task 4: Add signing information to the request and create the request URI**

After you calculate the signature, add it to the query string\. For more information, see [Add the Signature to the HTTP Request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-add-signature-to-request.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

1. Add the authentication information to the query string\.

   ```
   canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-Signature=" + signature
   ```

1. Create the URI for the request\.

   ```
   request_url = endpoint + canonical_uri + "?" + canonical_querystring
   ```

You use the request URI with your WebSocket library to make the request to the Amazon Transcribe Medical service\.

### Including WebSocket request headers<a name="websocket-headers-med"></a>

The request to Amazon Transcribe Medical must include the following headers\. Typically these med headers are managed by your WebSocket client library\.

```
Host: transcribestreaming.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:8443
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
Origin: request source
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Sec-WebSocket-Key: random key
```

Use the following values for the headers:
+ **Connection** – Always `Upgrade`\.
+ **Upgrade** – Always `websocket`\.
+ **Origin** – The URI of the WebSocket client\.
+ **Sec\-WebSocket\-Version** – The version of the WebSocket protocol to use\.
+ **Sec\-WebSocket\-Key** – A base\-64 encoded randomly generated string that identifies the request\.

## Handling the WebSocket upgrade response<a name="websocket-response-med"></a>

When Amazon Transcribe Medical receives your WebSocket request, it responds with a WebSocket upgrade response\. Typically, your WebSocket library manages this response and sets up a socket for communications with Amazon Transcribe Medical\.

The following is the response from Amazon Transcribe Medical\. Line breaks have been added to the `websocket-location` header for readability\.

```
HTTP/1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake
Connection: upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
websocket-origin: https://transcribestreaming.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:8443
websocket-location: transcribestreaming.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:8443/medical-stream-transcription-websocket?
&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE%2F20220208%2Fus-west-2%2Ftranscribe%2Faws4_request
&X-Amz-Date=20220208T235959Z
&X-Amz-Expires=250
&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host
&language-code=en-US
&media-encoding=flac
&sample-rate=16000
&type=dictation or conversation
&specialty=medical specialty (must be Primary Care)
&X-Amz-Signature=signature
x-amzn-RequestId: RequestId
x-amzn-SessionId: SessionId
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
sec-websocket-accept: token
```

The response has the following values:
+ `Connection` – Always `Upgrade`\.
+ `Upgrade` – Always `websocket`\.
+ `websocket-origin` – The URI of the WebSocket server that responded to the request\.
+ `websocket-location` – The contents of the request URI that was sent to the server\.
+ `x-amzn-RequestId` – An identifier for the request\. 
+ `x-amzn-SessionId` – An identifier for a transcription session\. 
+ `Strict-Transport-Security` – A header that informs browsers to access the endpoint using only HTTPS\.
+ `sec-websocket-accept` – The hash of the `Sec-WebSocket-Key` header sent in the request\.

## Making a WebSocket streaming request<a name="websocket-streaming-med-request"></a>

After the WebSocket connection is established, the client can start sending a sequence of audio frames\. Each frame contains one data frame that is encoded in event stream encoding\. For more information, see [Event stream encoding](streaming-setting-up.md#streaming-event-stream)\.

Each data frame contains three headers combined with a chunk of raw audio bytes\. The following table lists and describes the headers\. 


| Header name Byte Length | Header name \(string\) | Header value type | Value string byte length | Value string \(UTF\-8\) | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 13 | :content\-type | 7 | 24 | application/octet\-stream | 
| 11 | :event\-type | 7 | 10 | AudioEvent | 
| 13 | :message\-type | 7 | 5 | event | 

To end the audio data stream, send an empty audio chunk in an event stream encoded message\.

## Handling a WebSocket streaming response<a name="websocket-streaming-med-response-med"></a>

The response contains event stream encoded raw bytes in the payload\. It contains the standard prelude and the following headers\.


| Header name byte length | Header name \(string\) | Header value type | Value string byte length | Value string \(UTF\-8\) | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 13 | :content\-type | 7 | 24 | application/octet\-stream | 
| 11 | :event\-type | 7 | 15 | TranscriptEvent | 
| 13 | :message\-type | 7 | 5 | event | 

When you decode the binary response, you end up with a JSON structure with the results of the transcription\. For an example of the JSON response, see [Streaming transcription](streaming-med.md)\.

## Handling WebSocket streaming errors<a name="websocket-errors-med"></a>

If an exception occurs while processing your request, Amazon Transcribe Medical responds with a terminal WebSocket frame containing an event stream encoded response\. The response has the headers described in the following table, and the body of the response contains a descriptive error message\. After sending the exception response, Amazon Transcribe Medical sends a close frame\.


| Header name byte length | Header name \(string\) | Header value type | Value string byte length | Value string \(UTF\-8\) | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 13 | :content\-type | 7 | 24 | application/octet\-stream | 
| 15 | :exception\-type | 7 | varies | varies, see below | 
| 13 | :message\-type | 7 | 9 | exception | 

The `exception-type` header contains one of the following values:
+ `BadRequestException` – There was a client error when the stream was created, or an error occurred while streaming\-med data\. Make sure that your client is ready to accept data and try your request again\.
+ `InternalFailureException` – Amazon Transcribe Medical had a problem during the handshake with the client\. Try your request again\.
+ `LimitExceededException` – The client exceeded the concurrent stream limit\. For more information, see [Amazon Transcribe Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits-amazon-transcribe) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. Reduce the number of streams that you are transcribing\.
+ `UnrecognizedClientException` – The WebSocket upgrade request was signed with an incorrect access key or secret key\. Make sure that you are correctly creating the access key and try your request again\.

In addition, Transcribe Medical can return any of the common service errors\. For a list, see [Common Errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html)\.
