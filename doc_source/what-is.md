# What is Amazon Transcribe?<a name="what-is"></a>

Amazon Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition service that uses machine learning models to convert audio to text\. You can use Amazon Transcribe as a standalone transcription service or to add speech\-to\-text capabilities to any application\.

With Amazon Transcribe, you can improve accuracy for your specific use case with language customization, filter content to ensure customer privacy or audience\-appropriate language, analyze content in multi\-channel audio, partition the speech of individual speakers, and more\.

To view a complete list of features, see [Amazon Transcribe features](feature-matrix.md)\.

You can transcribe streaming media in real time or you can upload and transcribe media files\. To see which languages are supported for each type of transcription, refer to the [Supported languages and language\-specific features](supported-languages.md) table\.

**Important**  
Amazon Transcribe is covered under AWSâ€™s HIPAA eligibility and BAA which requires BAA customers to encrypt all PHI at rest and in transit when in use\.

## Amazon Transcribe use cases<a name="transcribe-use-cases"></a>

Amazon Transcribe is a robust speech\-to\-text service that offers a diverse array of features, many of which can be combined between Amazon Transcribe and other AWS services\.
+ Gain insight into agent\-customer calls using [Call Analytics](call-analytics.md)\. This feature automatically analyzes 11 different criteria without any customization on your part\. For each speaker, you get sentiment data, talk time, non\-talk time, loudness, interruptions, and talk speed\. Call summarization, call categorization, and turn\-by\-turn output are provided for the whole call\.

  We also have two analytics options for call center audio: [post\-call analytics](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/post-call-analytics-for-your-contact-center-with-amazon-language-ai-services/) \(designed for audio files located in an Amazon S3 bucket\) and [real\-time analytics](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/live-call-analytics-for-your-contact-center-with-amazon-language-ai-services/) \(designed for live audio streams\)\.
+ Get a summary of customer\-agent interactions with [call summarization](call-analytics-batch.md#tca-summarization-batch), which provides an at\-a\-glance summary of issues, action items, and outcomes for every call\.
+ Teach Amazon Transcribe industry\-specific terms, unique spelling, acronyms, and any words that are not being rendered correctly in your transcription results using [custom vocabularies](custom-vocabulary.md)\. Providing Amazon Transcribe with custom vocabularies can improve the accuracy of your transcription output\. See also: [Custom language models](custom-language-models.md)\.
+ Create [subtitles](subtitles.md) for your video files\. You can also use [content redaction](pii-redaction.md) \(only in US English\) and [vocabulary filtering](vocabulary-filtering.md) when generating subtitles to ensure your content is audience\-appropriate\. Note that filtered or redacted content shows as white space, `***`, or `[PII]` in your transcript and subtitle files, but **the audio itself is not altered**\.
+ Redact personally identifiable information \(PII\), such as social security numbers, from your transcripts using standard [content redaction](pii-redaction.md) or Call Analytics [sensitive data redaction](call-analytics-batch.md#tca-pii-redact-batch)\. Call Analytics can also **redact your audio file** by replacing spoken PII with silence\.
+ Partition individual speakers in an audio clip using [speaker diarization](diarization.md)\. When you activate speaker diarization, Amazon Transcribe attaches a unique attribute to the text from each speaker in your transcription output\.
+ Remove proprietary terms from your transcript using [vocabulary filtering](vocabulary-filtering.md)\. For example, you can mask the name of a new product in a pre\-launch stakeholder meeting\. Vocabulary filtering can also be used to mask profane, offensive, or audience\-inappropriate terms\.
+ Using multi\-channel audio, you can have Amazon Transcribe produce a separate transcript for each channel, or have all channels transcribed in one output file\. See [Transcribing multi\-channel audio](channel-id.md)\.
+ If your audio is not in a language you speak, let Amazon Transcribe identify the language for you using [language identification](lang-id.md)\. You can then use [Amazon Translate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is.html) to translate your transcript, and have [Amazon Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/what-is.html) read your transcript back to you\.
+ Improve [streaming transcription accuracy](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/what-was-that-increasing-subtitle-accuracy-for-live-broadcasts-using-amazon-transcribe/) with [partial result stabilization](streaming.md#streaming-partial-result-stabilization), which can also be used to [adjust the latency of your transcript](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-transcribe-now-supports-partial-results-stabilization-for-streaming-audio/)\.
