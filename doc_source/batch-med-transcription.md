Amazon Transcribe Medical batch transcription is available in US English\. It has the ability to transcribe accented English from non\-native speakers\. It supports the transcription of individual audio files\. You start a transcription job with either the AWS Management Console or by direct API call\.

You interact with Amazon Transcribe Medical using four main API resources\. To start a medical transcription job, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_StartMedicalTranscriptionJob.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_StartMedicalTranscriptionJob.html) API\. To retrieve information on a medical transcription job, use [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_GetMedicalTranscriptionJob.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_GetMedicalTranscriptionJob.html)\. You list medical transcription jobs with [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_ListMedicalTranscriptionJobs.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_ListMedicalTranscriptionJobs.html)\. You delete a medical transcription job with [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMedicalTranscriptionJob.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMedicalTranscriptionJob.html)\.

To transcribe an audio file, you use a transcription job\. You store the file as an object in an Amazon S3 bucket\. The input file must: 
+ Be in FLAC, MP3, MP4, or WAV file format\.
+ Use 16\-bit Linear PCM encoding\.
+ Be less than 4 hours in length and less than 2 GB in size
+ Use a sample rate of 16,000 Hz or higher

For best results: 
+ Use a lossless format, such as FLAC or WAV\.

When creating a medical transcription job, you specify the language, the medical specialty, and the audio type of the source file\. You input US English \(en\-US\) as the language and `PRIMARYCARE` as the medical specialty\. Entering primary care as the value enables you to generate transcriptions from source audio in the following medical specialties:
+ Family Medicine
+ Internal Medicine
+ Obstetrics and Gynecology \(OB\-GYN\)
+ Pediatrics

You have the choice between dictation and conversation for your audio type\. Choose dictation for audio files where the physician is giving a report about a patient visit or procedure\. Choose conversation for audio files that involve a conversation between a physician and a patient or a conversation between physicians\.

To store the output of your transcription job, select an Amazon S3 bucket that you've already created\. For more information on Amazon S3 buckets see [Getting Started with Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html)\.

The following are the minimum number of request parameters to enter in the sample JSON\.
