# Vulnerability analysis and management in Amazon Transcribe<a name="vulnerability-analysis-and-management"></a>

Configuration and IT controls are a shared responsibility between AWS and you, our customer\. For more information, see the AWS [shared responsibility model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)\.

## Amazon Transcribe and interface VPC endpoints \(AWS PrivateLink\)<a name="vpc-interface-endpoints"></a>

You can establish a private connection between your VPC and Amazon Transcribe by creating an *interface VPC endpoint*\. Interface endpoints are powered by [AWS PrivateLink](http://aws.amazon.com/privatelink), a technology that you can use to privately access Amazon Transcribe APIs without an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection\. Instances in your VPC don't need public IP addresses to communicate with Amazon Transcribe APIs\. Traffic between your VPC and Amazon Transcribe does not leave the Amazon network\. 

Each interface endpoint is represented by one or more [Elastic Network Interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) in your subnets\.

For more information, see [Interface VPC endpoints \(AWS PrivateLink\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

### Considerations for Amazon Transcribe VPC endpoints<a name="vpc-endpoint-considerations"></a>

Before you set up an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon Transcribe, make sure that you review [Interface endpoint properties and limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#vpce-interface-limitations) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

Amazon Transcribe supports making calls to all of its API actions from your VPC\.

### Creating an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon Transcribe<a name="vpc-endpoint-create"></a>

You can create a VPC endpoint for the Amazon Transcribe service using the Amazon VPC AWS Management Console or AWS CLI\. For more information, see [Creating an interface endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

For batch transcriptions in Amazon Transcribe, create a VPC endpoint using the following service name: 
+ com\.amazonaws\.*us\-west\-2*\.transcribe

For streaming transcriptions in Amazon Transcribe, create a VPC endpoint using the following service name: 
+ com\.amazonaws\.*us\-west\-2*\.transcribestreaming

If you enable private DNS for the endpoint, you can make API requests to Amazon Transcribe using its default DNS name for the AWS Region, for example, `transcribestreaming.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`\. 

For more information, see [Accessing a service through an interface endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#access-service-though-endpoint) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

### Creating a VPC endpoint policy for Amazon Transcribe<a name="vpc-endpoint-policy"></a>

You can attach an endpoint policy to your VPC endpoint that controls access to the streaming service or batch transcription service of Amazon Transcribe\. The policy specifies the following information:
+ The principal that can perform actions\.
+ The actions that can be performed\.
+ The resources on which actions can be performed\.

For more information, see [Controlling access to services with VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

**Example: VPC endpoint policy for Amazon Transcribe batch transcription actions**  
The following is an example of an endpoint policy for a batch transcription in Amazon Transcribe\. When attached to an endpoint, this policy grants access to the listed Amazon Transcribe actions for all principals on all resources\.

```
{
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Principal":"*",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "transcribe:StartTranscriptionJob",
            "transcribe:ListTranscriptionJobs"
         ],
         "Resource":"*"
      }
   ]
}
```

**Example: VPC endpoint policy for Amazon Transcribe streaming transcription actions**  
The following is an example of an endpoint policy for a streaming transcription in Amazon Transcribe\. When attached to an endpoint, this policy grants access to the listed Amazon Transcribe actions for all principals on all resources\.

```
{
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Principal":"*",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "transcribe:StartStreamTranscription",
            "transcribe:StartStreamTranscriptionWebsocket"
         ],
         "Resource":"*"
      }
   ]
}
