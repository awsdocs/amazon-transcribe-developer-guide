# Transcribing with the AWS SDKs<a name="getting-started-sdk"></a>

You can use SDKs for both batch and streaming transcriptions\. If you're transcribing a media file located in an Amazon S3 bucket, you're performing a batch transcription\. If you're transcribing a real\-time stream of audio data, you're performing a streaming transcription\.

For a list of the programming languages you can use with Amazon Transcribe, see [Supported programming languages](supported-languages.md#supported-sdks)\. Note that streaming transcriptions are not supported with all AWS SDKs\. To view supported media formats and other media requirements and constraints, see [Data input and output](how-input.md)\.

For more information on all available AWS SDKs and builder tools, refer to [Tools to Build on AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools)\.

**Tip**  
For additional examples using the AWS SDKs, including feature\-specific, scenario, and cross\-service examples, refer to the [Code examples for Amazon Transcribe using AWS SDKs](service_code_examples.md) chapter\.  
You can also find code samples in the [AWS Samples repository](https://github.com/aws-samples) on GitHub\.
