# Transcribing with the AWS SDKs<a name="getting-started-sdk"></a>

You can use SDKs for both batch and streaming transcriptions\.

To get started with batch transcriptions, refer to [Batch transcriptions](getting-started-sdk-batch.md)\. Note that prior to starting a batch transcription, you must first upload your media file into an Amazon S3 bucket\.

To get started with streaming transcriptions, refer to [Streaming transcriptions](getting-started-sdk-streaming.md)\. For streaming transcriptions, you can transcribe a streamed media file or a live media stream\. Note that streaming transcriptions are not supported with all AWS SDKs\.

For a list of the programming languages you can use with Amazon Transcribe, see [Supported programming languages](supported-languages.md#supported-sdks)\. To view supported media formats and other media requirements and constraints, see [Data input and output](how-input.md)\.

**Tip**  
For additional examples using the AWS SDKs, including feature\-specific, scenario, and cross\-service examples, refer to the [Code examples for Amazon Transcribe using AWS SDKs](service_code_examples.md) chapter\.
