# Using Amazon EventBridge with Amazon Transcribe<a name="monitoring-events"></a>

With Amazon EventBridge, you can respond to state changes in your Amazon Transcribe jobs by initiating events in other AWS services\. When a transcription job changes state, EventBridge automatically sends an event to an event stream\. You create rules that define the events that you want to monitor in the event stream and the action that EventBridge should take when those events occur\. For example, routing the event to another service \(or target\), which can then take an action\. You could, for example, configure a rule to route an event to an AWS Lambda function when a transcription job has completed successfully\.

Before using EventBridge, note the following definitions:
+ **Event**–An event indicates a change in the state of one of your transcription jobs\. For example, when the `TranscriptionJobStatus` of a job changes from `IN_PROGRESS` to `COMPLETED`\.
+ **Target**–A target is another AWS service that processes an event\. For example, AWS Lambda or Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\)\. A target receives events in JSON format\.
+ **Rule**–A rule matches incoming events that you want EventBridge to watch for and routes them to a target or targets for processing\. If a rule routes an event to multiple targets, all of the targets process the event in parallel\. A rule can customize the JSON sent to the target\.

Amazon EventBridge are emitted on a best\-effort basis\. For more information about creating and managing events in EventBridge, see [Amazon EventBridge events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events.html) in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*\.

## Defining EventBridge rules<a name="defining-rules"></a>

To define EventBridge rules, use the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events)\. When you define a rule, use Amazon Transcribe as the service name\. For an example of how to create an EventBridge rule, see [Amazon EventBridge rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.html)\.

The following is an example of an EventBridge rule for Amazon Transcribe that's initiated when a transcription job's status changes to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`\. 

```
{
    "source": [
        "aws.transcribe"
    ],
    "detail-type": [
        "Transcribe Job State Change"
    ],
    "detail": {
        "TranscriptionJobStatus": [
            "COMPLETED",
            "FAILED"
        ]
    }
}
```

The rule contains the following fields:
+ `source`–The source of the event\. For Amazon Transcribe, this is always `aws.transcribe`\.
+ `detail-type`–An identifier for the details of the event\. For Amazon Transcribe, this is always `Transcribe Job State Change`\.
+ `detail`–The new job status of the transcription job\. In this example, the rule initiates an event when the job status changes to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`\.

## Amazon Transcribe events<a name="events"></a>

Amazon EventBridge logs several Amazon Transcribe events:
+ [Transcription job events](#job-event)
+ [Language identification events](#lang-id-event)
+ [Call Analytics events](#analytics-event)
+ [Call Analytics post\-call events](#analytics-stream-event)
+ [Vocabulary events](#vocab-event)

These events all contain the following shared fields:
+ `version`: The version of the event data\. This value is always `0`\.
+ `id`: A unique identifier generated by EventBridge for the event\.
+ `detail-type`: An identifier for the details of the event\. For example, `Transcribe Job State Change`\.
+ `source`: The source of the event\. For Amazon Transcribe this is always `aws.transcribe`\.
+ `account`: The AWS account ID of the account that generated the API call\.
+ `time`: The date and time the event is delivered\.
+ `region`: The AWS Region in which the request is made\.
+ `resources`: The resources used by the API call\. For Amazon Transcribe, this field is always empty\.
+ `detail`: Additional details about the event\.
  + `FailureReason`: This field is present if the state or status changes to `FAILED`, and describes the reason for the `FAILED` state or status\.
  + Each event type has additional unique fields that are displayed under `detail`\. These unique fields are defined in the following sections after each event example\.

### Transcription job events<a name="job-event"></a>

When a job's state changes from `IN_PROGRESS` to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`, Amazon Transcribe generates an event\. To identify the job that changed state and initiate the event in your target, use the event's `TranscriptionJobName` field\. An Amazon Transcribe event contains the following information\. A `FailureReason` field is added under `detail` if your transcription job status is `FAILED`\.

Note that this event applies only to the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_StartTranscriptionJob.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_StartTranscriptionJob.html) API operation\.
