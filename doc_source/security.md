# Security in Amazon Transcribe<a name="security"></a>

Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority\. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture built to meet the requirements of the most security\-sensitive organizations\.

Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you\. The [shared responsibility model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) describes this as security *of* the cloud and security *in* the cloud:
+ **Security of the cloud**: AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud\. AWS also provides you with services you can use securely\. Third\-party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the [AWS Compliance Programs](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/)\. To learn about the compliance programs that apply to Amazon Transcribe, see [AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/)\.
+ **Security in the cloud**: Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use\. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your companyâ€™s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations\.
