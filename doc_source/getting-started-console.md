# Transcribing with the AWS Management Console<a name="getting-started-console"></a>

You can use the AWS console for batch and streaming transcriptions\. If you're transcribing a media file located in an Amazon S3 bucket, you're performing a batch transcription\. If you're transcribing a real\-time stream of audio data, you're performing a streaming transcription\.

Before starting a batch transcription, you must first upload your media file to an Amazon S3 bucket\. For streaming transcriptions using the AWS Management Console, you must use your computer microphone\.

To view supported media formats and other media requirements and constraints, see [Data input and output](how-input.md)\.
