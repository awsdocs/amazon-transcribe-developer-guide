# Medical specialties and terms<a name="how-it-works-med"></a>

When creating a medical transcription job, you specify the language, the medical specialty, and the audio type of the source file\. You input US English \(en\-US\) as the language and `PRIMARYCARE` as the medical specialty\. Entering primary care as the value enables you to generate transcriptions from source audio in the following medical specialties:
+ Family Medicine
+ Internal Medicine
+ Obstetrics and Gynecology \(OB\-GYN\)
+ Pediatrics

You have the choice between dictation and conversation for your audio type\. Choose dictation for audio files where the physician is giving a report about a patient visit or procedure\. Choose conversation for audio files that involve a conversation between a physician and a patient or a conversation between physicians\.

To store the output of your transcription job, select an Amazon S3 bucket that you've already created\. For more information on Amazon S3 buckets see [Getting Started with Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html)\.

The following are the minimum number of request parameters to enter in the sample JSON\.
